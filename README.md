# Internship Tasks – Machine Learning

This repository contains the two machine learning tasks I completed for my internship:

1. **Iris Flower Classification**
2. **House Price Prediction (California Housing Dataset)**

---

## Task 1: Iris Flower Classification
**File:** `iris.py`

- Used the Iris dataset from scikit-learn.
- Explored the data with pairplots, histograms, and boxplots.
- Split the data into train and test sets.
- Trained a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier.
- Evaluated the model using accuracy, a confusion matrix, and a classification report.

**Skills:** Data visualization, classification, evaluation metrics.

## Task 2: House Price Prediction
**File:** `housePrice.py`

- Worked with the California Housing dataset.
- Performed exploratory data analysis using histograms, a heatmap, and scatter plots.
- Scaled features using StandardScaler.
- Trained a Linear Regression model.
- Evaluated the model with mean squared error (MSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and R² score.

**Skills:** Regression, data preprocessing, model evaluation.
